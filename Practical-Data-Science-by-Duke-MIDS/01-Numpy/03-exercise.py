# Ques_2. Now create the vector and check your intuition!
test1 = np.array([42, 47, 1.618])
print(test1.dtype)

# Ques_3. Now we are going to create a vector from the list [47, True, 3.14]. Before you create it, what do you think the `dtype` will be? What do you think the array will look like?
print("float64")

# Ques_4. Now create the vector and check your intuition!
test2 = np.array([47, True, 3.14])
