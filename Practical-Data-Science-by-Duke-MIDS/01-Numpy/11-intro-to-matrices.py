# Similarly, matrices can be added if they have the same size.
# If one also had a matrix of tax refunds, and wanted to calculate everyoneâ€™s total after-tax incomes, one could just add the matrices:
refunds = np.array([[5_000, 3_000], [4_000, 4_000], [8_000, 7_000]])
print(refunds)

total_income = salaries + refunds
